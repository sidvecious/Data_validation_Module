Open question for data_validation_module:

A - DATAFRAME:
    1 - the architecture with dictionary must be replaced
        with an architecture with classes
    2 - the numeric columns from the GeoDataFrame are in soil_harmonization and
        upload_to_posgresql: String that represent numbers.
        This is not the expected value! is needed a change of values or
        additional functions in this module.
    3 - The parameters Type in the dataframe_configuration is now necessary
        only in 2-4 functions, consider whether to write 2 more functions and remove the parameter


B - SERIES:
    1 - functions and tests for only Series are not included

C - JSON FILE:
    1 - functions and tests for json file are not included
