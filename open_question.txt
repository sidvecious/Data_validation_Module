Open question for data_validation_module:

A - DATAFRAME:
    1 - Bug in src.py: import of the validation functions required
    2 - iterate_data_config is too big and has different functionality
        must be split?
    3 - Bug in src.py: the import of the dictionary DTATAFRAME_DICT is not pythonic
    4 - iterate_column has tests only for 3 validation function,
        other 6 are needed
    5 - the functions: check_dataframe, split_invalid_data_rows,
        validate_column, and iterate_column are not tested!
    6 - the numeric columns from the GeoDataFrame are in soil_harmonization and
        upload_to_posgresql: String that represent numbers.
        This is not the expected value! is needed a change of values or
        additional functions in this module.


B - SERIES:
    1 - functions and tests for only Series are not included

C - JSON FILE:
    1 - functions and tests for json file are not included
