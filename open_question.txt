Open question for data_validation_module:

A - DATAFRAME:
    1 - the architecture with dictionary must be replaced
        with an architecture with classes
    2 - iterate_column has tests only for 5 validation function,
        other 4 are needed
    3 - the auto casting of the DataFrame makes it difficult to validate the integer,
        a single row float or np.NaN or None makes the whole column float
    4 - the numeric columns from the GeoDataFrame are in soil_harmonization and
        upload_to_posgresql: String that represent numbers.
        This is not the expected value! is needed a change of values or
        additional functions in this module.

B - SERIES:
    1 - functions and tests for only Series are not included

C - JSON FILE:
    1 - functions and tests for json file are not included
